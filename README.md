# 🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project predicts used car prices using a linear regression model with features like brand, body, mileage, engine volume, engine type, registration status, and year.

## 📋 Project Overview
The goal is to predict car prices using linear regression while ensuring accuracy through thorough data preprocessing and validation.

## 🔍 Steps Involved

Data Exploration: Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis of numerical variables.

Data Preprocessing: Handling null values, removing outliers, log transformation of price, and creating dummy variables.

Feature Engineering: Multicollinearity check (VIF), scaling, and train-test split.

Model Building: Linear regression fitting and evaluation on training and test data.

Results: Summary of features, weights, and model accuracy evaluation.

## 📚 Libraries Used

seaborn

matplotlib

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

statsmodels

## 🔑 Key Findings

Removing outliers and handling multicollinearity improved model accuracy.

Log transformation of price ensured a linear relationship with numerical variables.

Model predictions were accurate, with residuals normally distributed around zero.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting used car prices using linear regression, ensuring data quality and model accuracy.
